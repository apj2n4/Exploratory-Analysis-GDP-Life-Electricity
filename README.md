Abstract
This project tries to shed light on the relationship between Life Expectancy, Electricity Consumption per capita (in kWh) and GDP growth per capita (in Y2000 $) for around 90 countries. The purpose is to understand whether human life expectancy in years is positively correlated with energy consumption and GDP growth. The question is whether more industrialized nations which have on average higher energy consumption and higher GDP per capita also have higher life expectancy.

This hypothesis appears obvious but having actual data to support it will be very helpful. Governments in developing and emerging countries like India, China and African nations can use such type of analysis for energy infrastructure planning and economic development. Better energy infrastructure leads to higher economic activity and more economic activity will create demand for more energy production and the cycle goes on leading to higher life expectancy. This positive correlation is explored in this project using various visualization techniques. Population of the various countries were also plotted. Different visualization techniques were used to represent this multivariate data to understand trends. War leads to reduction in life expectancy and this is quite stark in the case of Libya and Syria in the recent years.
